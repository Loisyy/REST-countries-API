## My process

### Built with

This project is built using the following technologies and tools:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, specifically single-page applications.
Vite: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
Font Awesome: A popular icon set and toolkit used for adding scalable vector icons to the project.
React Router: A library for routing in React applications, allowing navigation between different components.
ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code to ensure code quality and consistency.
PostCSS: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, used here in conjunction with Tailwind CSS.
Babel: A JavaScript compiler that converts ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript.


### What I learned

I have learnt how to set up a modern web development environment using React and Vite, integrate styling with Tailwind CSS, handle routing with React Router, manage state and effects in React, fetch and display data from APIs, and use Font Awesome for icons REST and API. Additionally, you've gained experience with version control using Git and GitHub, and running/building your project for development and production.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
